# Vanishing Gradient Problem and Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains four Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating the Vanishing Gradient problem in deep learning and presenting three different solutions to mitigate it. The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. **Vanishing_Gradient_Problem.ipynb**
   - Provides an explanation of the Vanishing Gradient problem in the context of deep learning.
   - Illustrates the challenges that arise when the gradient becomes too faint during training.

2. **Solution_1_Reduce_Model_Complexity.ipynb**
   - Explores the first solution to the Vanishing Gradient problem: reducing model complexity.
   - Discusses how simplifying the architecture can help maintain stronger gradients.

3. **Solution_2_ReLU_Activation.ipynb**
   - Demonstrates the second solution: using Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions.
   - Shows how ReLU can alleviate the vanishing gradient issue by allowing for more effective learning.

4. **Solution_3_Weight_Initialization.ipynb**
   - Introduces the third solution: using proper weight initialization techniques.
   - Explains how initializing weights carefully can contribute to preventing the vanishing gradient problem.

## How to Use

1. Open and run the notebooks in sequential order for a step-by-step understanding of the Vanishing Gradient problem and its solutions.
2. Experiment with different configurations, and observe how each solution affects the model's training.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these solutions to your own deep learning projects!
